                                        <strong>Java</strong><br>
                                        Java is an open source and platform-independent programming language, which
                                        can
                                        be
                                        used for almost any
                                        situation thanks to its versatility. It is object-oriented like most web
                                        programming
                                        languages. This
                                        means that it focuses on concrete applications. Its vast number of web
                                        frameworks
                                        and libraries, which
                                        generally have comprehensive documentation, makes it easier to create even
                                        highly
                                        complex web
                                        projects. Programs written in Java are easy to expand upon, can be scaled as
                                        required and are easy to
                                        maintain, provided that the programmer who wrote them knew what they were
                                        doing.

                                        Since Java is comparatively difficult to learn, resulting in fewer experts
                                        in
                                        this
                                        programming
                                        language, clients will have to deal with higher costs than when using other
                                        programming languages.
                                        Meanwhile, programmers who are proficient in Java are likely to have a
                                        comparatively
                                        high income.
                                    </p>

                                        <strong>JavaScript</strong><br>
                                        Despite its name, this dynamic, object-oriented scripting language has
                                        nothing
                                        to do
                                        with Java, apart
                                        from them both being based on C. In 1995, Netscape developed JavaScript,
                                        originally
                                        called LiveScript,
                                        with the goal of expanding HTML and CSS to enable programmers to evaluate
                                        user
                                        interactions and
                                        dynamically display content. Today, JavaScript is not just used for web
                                        browsers
                                        but
                                        also for
                                        micro-controllers and servers. The name JavaScript was chosen merely because
                                        of
                                        Java’s popularity. At
                                        the time, people wanted to be associated with it. This was a great success.
                                        Today,
                                        almost all the most
                                        popular websites use JavaScript as their programming language of choice on
                                        the
                                        client side.
                                        Additionally, JavaScript has extensive frameworks and libraries.

                                        This programming language is dynamically typed and classless. It gives
                                        programmers
                                        the choice of
                                        object-oriented, procedural, or functional programming, making it a highly
                                        versatile
                                        programming
                                        language. This is especially apparent in web browsers. For example,
                                        JavaScript
                                        can
                                        be used to
                                        dynamically change websites, validate form entries even before they are sent
                                        to
                                        the
                                        target server,
                                        switch dialog boxes as well as integrate scripts for downloading and
                                        uploading.
                                        JavaScript has also
                                        become an essential tool for online marketing, as many advertisements are
                                        programmed
                                        with it. This
                                        language can also be used to read and write cookies, which makes modern
                                        marketing
                                        strategies such as
                                        targeting possible. In short, JavaScript has helped shape the modern
                                        internet
                                        and is
                                        an integral part
                                        of today's web browsing experience.

                                        beginner-friendly and can be integrated into HTML. Therefore, it is often
                                        one of

                                        an aspiring programmer learns. Many website operators still rely on PHP
                                        today,
                                        even
                                        though the
                                        language is widely viewed as a bit obsolete. Some of its most important
                                        advantages
                                        include its broad
                                        support for various databases and its efficient integration of internet
                                        protocol.
                                        PHP has received
                                        several updates since its creation and is currently on version 7. This
                                        language
                                        has
                                        an open source
                                        license and is available free of charge.
                                        PHP processes the code on the server side, bypassing the web browser's
                                        interpretation, which is
                                        usually encountered in other popular internet programming languages. This
                                        also
                                        means
                                        that PHP is
                                        subject to stateless HTTP and stresses the queried web server much more than
                                        programming languages
                                        which only send the source code to a dedicated web browser. PHP is also
                                        criticized
                                        for its weak typing
                                        and lack of standardized error-handling functions. However, the fact that
                                        many
                                        major
                                        websites still
                                        use PHP is proof of its popularity. Problems can arise, though, if website
                                        operators
                                        use outdated PHP
                                        versions which compromise the security and stability of the website.

                                        Python is known as a high-level programming language and uses compact yet
                                        easy
                                        to

                                        Python is also easy to type because you do not need to separate blocks of
                                        code
                                        by
                                        using special
                                        characters but rather by indenting. This is why the language is considered
                                        to be
                                        enjoyable to learn
                                        and use. You can use it as required either for object-oriented,
                                        aspect-oriented,
                                        or
                                        functional
                                        programming. Python is also dynamic and is therefore often used as a
                                        scripting
                                        language. Python is
                                        supported by an active community and is kept up-to-date and relevant by the
                                        non-profit Python Software
                                        Foundation. This language is freely available and can be used with most
                                        current
                                        operating systems.

                                        Many popular web services like YouTube and other Google projects are
                                        partially
                                        based
                                        on Python. The
                                        video game industry has also embraced this programming language. The same
                                        can be
                                        said for scientific
                                        projects. Python has become highly popular for this purpose primarily
                                        because
                                        most
                                        scientific
                                        databases can be easily integrated with the language and because tasks which
                                        involve
                                        collecting
                                        empirical data can be carried out efficiently using it. Python is therefore

                                        for its relatively
                                        low execution speed and for how long-winded the definitions of its methods

                                        Ruby is another high-level programming language. It was developed in the
                                        mid-1990s
                                        by Yukihiro
                                        Matsumoto. This purely object-oriented programming language boasts dynamic
                                        typing
                                        and reflection as
                                        well as automatic garbage collection. Ruby’s major distinguishing feature is
                                        its
                                        object-oriented focus
                                        in which every value and class is an object. Unlike other object-oriented
                                        programming languages, there
                                        are no primitive data types in Ruby. To put it briefly, “everything is an
                                        object.”

                                        Ruby's syntax is conveniently flexible. For example, the use of brackets is
                                        often
                                        optional. This makes
                                        the language easy to read and often makes it look like a markup language. In
                                        spite
                                        of this, Ruby is
                                        very deep and also allows for meta-programming with which programmers can
                                        generate
                                        methods, modify the
                                        inheritance hierarchy and change other constants in the programming language
                                        as
                                        they
                                        see fit. This is
                                        why Ruby is considered “easy to learn but hard to master”. Critics have
                                        voiced
                                        concerns about the
                                        negative consequences of having typos in program code. In such cases,
                                        unexpected
                                        run-time errors can
                                        lead to tedious debugging sessions. Ruby is often used as a scripting
                                        language
                                        for
                                        web servers but
                                        also surprisingly often in the video game industry. This language is
                                        available

                                        <strong>C++</strong><br>
                                        C++ is based on C, one of the oldest programming languages. The development
                                        of
                                        this
                                        language, which
                                        was then thought of as an extension of C, began in 1979, but it was not
                                        released
                                        to
                                        the public until
                                        1985. It is still very popular today. C++ is one of the programming
                                        languages
                                        with
                                        an ISO
                                        (International Organization for Standardization) standard. It is also
                                        considered
                                        to
                                        be machine
                                        oriented and efficient as well as highly abstractable and complex. C++ is
                                        fundamentally easy to learn,
                                        especially because the core language is concise using approximately 60 key
                                        words.
                                        The language becomes
                                        more complex and comprehensive through its standard library.

                                        C++’s greatest strengths are its variety of combinations and its efficient
                                        machine-oriented
                                        programming. This allows highly complex processes to be integrated into
                                        basic
                                        functions. As a result,
                                        C++ programmers can save time by relying on the core language and the
                                        standard
                                        library. Due to the
                                        fact that it is heavily based on C, this programming language has some
                                        disadvantages, such as its
                                        comparatively messy syntax. Nevertheless, C++ is one of the most popular
                                        programming
                                        languages today
                                        when it comes to system and application programming. However, when it comes
                                        to
                                        web
                                        programming
                                        languages, C++ has to be ranked lower than Java, JavaScript, and C#.

                                        <strong>C#</strong><br>
                                        The relatively new programming language C#, pronounced as “C sharp“, was
                                        released in
                                        2001 and is
                                        considered to be a general-purpose language. It is type-safe,
                                        object-oriented
                                        and
                                        fundamentally
                                        platform-independent. However, it was specifically developed by Microsoft
                                        for
                                        the
                                        .NET Framework. C#
                                        is often also referred to as “Visual C#”, mostly for implementations.
                                        Conceptually,
                                        the language is
                                        related to Java and C++ among others, but it extends the object-oriented
                                        modelto
                                        include attributes
                                        which store information about classes, objects and methods as well as
                                        delegates
                                        which refer to methods
                                        for specific classes. This primarily results in a more accurate error
                                        description
                                        when compiling code,
                                        saving developers a lot of time.

                                        Many people believe C# is the most important programming language web
                                        developers
                                        should learn besides
                                        Java. As an object-oriented web programming language, C# offers the
                                        bestcombination
                                        of functionality
                                        and depth. Critics have warned that using C# ties you to Microsoft's .NET
                                        Framework.
                                        Having said that,
                                        programmers use it for a large portion of the market. Many programmers now
                                        rely
                                        on
                                        C#, be it for
                                        developing for Windows systems or for video games on Xbox and PC. C# is
                                        mainly
                                        used
                                        as a web
                                        programming language for web API's and various web applications.

                                        <strong>Perl</strong><br>
                                        The free programming language Perl appeared in 1987 and provided the
                                        inspiration
                                        as
                                        an interpreted
                                        programming language and a scripting language for languages such as PHP,
                                        JavaScript,
                                        Ruby and Python.
                                        The programmers primarily used programming languages in the C family. This
                                        language
                                        is fundamentally
                                        platform-independent and was originally designed for network and system
                                        administration. Since then,
                                        Perl has also established itself as one of the most popular programming
                                        languages
                                        for web software,
                                        bioinformatics and finance.

                                        Programmers who use Perl benefit from a high level of freedom and efficient
                                        problem-solving. For
                                        example, you can modify texts with regular expressions. Moreover, there are
                                        many
                                        freely available
                                        modules for Perl which can be retrieved from the Perl library CPAN. The
                                        programming
                                        language Perl is
                                        designed with the goal of always offering programmers several ways to
                                        accomplish
                                        their objectives
                                        while remaining simple and efficient and working in a context-sensitive
                                        manner.
                                        Perl
                                        played a key role
                                        in the spread of the World Wide Web and continues to play a huge role today
                                        as a
                                        web
                                        programming
                                        language. Perl is used less frequently when proximity to the hardware (e.g.
                                        web
                                        servers) and speed
                                        (e.g. drivers) play a role.
